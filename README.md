## Traicy student project

**Concept**

Traicy is an application that detects numbers and letters formed by humans. It filters images using digital image processing. A Convolutional Neural Network created with the TensorFlow API analyzes the filtered images and predicts the numbers or letters.
The project consists of following folders:
cnn     - datasets and scripts to read data, train a CNN model and make predictions
configs - json files and a script, that is used for the communicaton between the GUI and the image filters
data    - several image files that were used to test the CNNs or to make a dataset
DEBUG   -
filters - image filter scripts and scripts to prepare image data for a dataset
gui     - everything belonging to our user interface written in C#
